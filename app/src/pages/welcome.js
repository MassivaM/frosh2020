        To the Engineering Incoming Class of 2020,
        <br></br>
        <br></br>


Congratulations on your acceptance to McGill University! Though the circumstances may not be as expected, rest assured that our Frosh Coordinators are hard at work to make sure that we provide you with a warm welcome to the McGill Engineering Community!
<br></br>
<br></br>
As we’re sure you know, McGill has announced that classes will be held remotely (online) for the Fall 2020 semester, and in order to reach all participants and to ensure the safety of everyone involved, Fall Orientation Week will also be taking place online this year. Details about the programming and services being made available to you will be released as we make plans in the coming weeks and months leading up to the first day of classes on September 2nd, 2020.
<br></br>
<br></br>
We are determined to continue exploring our ability to hold in-person events later in the 2020-2021 academic year.  If these events are to happen, we will ensure the safety of these events and comply with all government regulations.
<br></br>
<br></br>
No matter the platform, our goals for Engineering Frosh 2020 remain unchanged. We cannot wait to introduce you to the fun and inclusive environment at McGill Engineering and welcome all of you to the tight-knit community we have here within the Engineering Undergraduate Society.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Looking forward to seeing all of you at Orientation Week!
